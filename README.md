# Knowledge Graph Construction

## Step 1: Read Text and Split into Chunks
First, we read the text and divide it into chunks. This segmentation is essential for the subsequent steps in the knowledge graph construction process.

## Step 2: Entity and Relationship Recognition
From the text, identify entities and relationships. This step prepares for the graph embedding process, where entities are treated as nodes and relationships as edges.

## Step 3: Text to Vector Embedding
Convert the text into vector embeddings and store them in a vector store. This step is crucial for the later stages of analysis and computation.

## Step 4: Graph Construction Based on Relationships
Construct the graph based on the identified relationships. Here's an example to illustrate:

### Example:
**Text 1:** "Elon Musk is the CEO of SpaceX and Tesla."  
**Text 2:** "SpaceX is located in Hawthorne, California."

### Knowledge Graph Construction Process:
1. **Entity Recognition:** Identify entities like "Elon Musk," "SpaceX," "Tesla," "California," and "Hawthorne."
2. **Relationship Extraction:** Identify relationships such as "CEO" and "located in."
3. **Text Embedding:** Convert these entities and relationships into vector representations.
4. **Graph Construction:** Build a graph with the following nodes and edges:
    - **Nodes:** Elon Musk, SpaceX, Tesla, California, Hawthorne
    - **Edges:** 
        - Elon Musk -[CEO]-> SpaceX
        - Elon Musk -[CEO]-> Tesla
        - SpaceX -[located in]-> Hawthorne

## Step 5: Clustering Analysis with Leiden Algorithm
Apply the Leiden algorithm on the constructed knowledge graph for clustering analysis, dividing the graph into communities based on their relationships.

## Step 6: Graph Embedding for Community Analysis
Embed the clustered graph into a vector space to facilitate subsequent analysis and computations.
